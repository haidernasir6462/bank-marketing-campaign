<!-- Data Mining Solutions for Direct Marketing Campaign -->
Developing an AI solution for saving the cost of a direct marketing campaign by reducing false positive (wasted call) and false negative (missed customer) decisions.

# scenario
A Bank has decided to save the cost of a direct marketing campaign based on phone calls offering a product to a client. A cost efficient solution is expected to support the campaign with predictions for a given client profile whether the client buys the product or not.

# Method and Technology
To design a solution, will use Data Mining techniques such as Decision Trees and Random forest. We will use R scripting as it is recommended: 
(i) a Cloud CoCalc,  
(ii) a development suite RStudio or an RStudio Cloud. 
Other scripting languages such as Python supported e.g. by Google Colab online platform.
